# Deep-space
Java and Ruby school project simulating a game with space stations fighting enemy ships.
Two instances of the same game were developed separately with Java and Ruby for the purpose of seeing how different languages approach Object Oriented Programming.
Learned to use UML(Unified Modeling language) and implemented structural and sequence diagrams. Also learned encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance
through practice, as well as the importance of thoughtful and premeditated design.
